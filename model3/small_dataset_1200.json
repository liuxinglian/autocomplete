We were here because of a Groupon, which got us brunch, cut-the-line passes (which did indeed cut us straight to the front of the line!), and mimosas, for ~$30 a seat. I'm torn on whether it was worth that much - some of the food was excellent, some was terrible, a lot was in between - but it absolutely would not have been worth remotely $30 without the mimosas and the cut-the-line passes, it definitely wouldn't have been worth a bunch extra to cut the line, and it also definitely wouldn't have been worth waiting in the absolutely freakishly enormous line (around 11 AM on a Friday) at normal price. So I guess I can't really recommend it that much. \n\nTheir food is definitely *expansive*, I'll give them that much. Granted, we got to see both the breakfast and lunch food (though there's a lot of overlap), but still. It is definitely a large place, but not all of the food was really worth it: \n* Sliders: so good. \n* Rest of their meat selection: salty and clearly not the best quality. Tossed it. \n* Seafood: kinda mediocre. \n* Cheese at their charcuterie: pretty respectable, though not amazing. \n* Meat at their charcuterie: tasted cheap. \n* Dim sum: pretty respectable. \n* The rest of their Asian food: tasted like cheap buffet Asian food. Not worth it. Specifically calling out the supposedly-sushi for tasting like cheap sushi you'd get at a buffet. Which, granted, is where we were, but for this expensive, I'd expect a little better. \n* Tacos: mediocre, not terrible but I've had way better. \n* Desserts: very expansive, and sooo good. Well, so good except the ice cream. The ice cream was crap. Funny how that works. \n* I'm sure there were other things, too, but those are all the ones I can remember. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this *were* the best casino buffet in LV, but that'd be kinda sad, cause it wasn't really that great.

I got the Neuton size... 5oz. My friend got another creation same size + waffle cone. Our total ~$13. Okay, that's fine... because I really enjoyed my \"atomic apple pie\" even though it tasted more like cinnamon ice cream.. (where are the apples?!). My friend got a creation that was good, but reminded me too much of sun tan lotion. \n\nSecond time: I got the chocolate hazelnut with banana mix-ins and my friend got the chocolate mole.

I was hoping for something incredible like NUTELLA... but was given something that tasted like dust with cocoa powder.. My friend who got the chocolate mole felt as if he was eating Indian food. His concoction was the spiciest ice cream (EVER) with no hint of chocolate, or any sweetness at all for that matter. The 14$ spent that day could have gone to dairy queen... \n\nRegardless, I think this is  a place to visit at least once, just to get it out of your system, if you happen to like it, then so be it.

There were a lot of activities for kids as they had slides, swings, an animal farm and a corn maze! It's a great place for a family outing (they also had many picnic tables).

They were caramel and zebra (white and milk chocolate-covered goodness). Yummy!\n\nWhile in Vegas, I spent a lot of time in the food court. That isn't exactly a news bulletin.

I didn't have any sort of pancakes with my breakfast, which was standard eggs, bacon, hash browns, but I was brought two different syrups, but not hot sauce or ketchup, and it took about an hour & 1/2.  If you have dietary concerns, there weren't any special notes or way to make that in the tablet for room service orders.

I didn't cruise through the hotel extensively, but really love that I didn't have to walk a mile from any main entrance to get to my room even though this place is HUGE.  It also wasn't massively smokey on the casino floor getting to the room elevators.  Non smoking floor actually has no trace or hint of smoke like some hotels. \n\nLift bar has had live music a few nights which is nice, and it's not hard to find the ride share areas at this hotel.  \n\nOverall...big wow.

I come here so often, if only they had stamp cards where you can get a free one for every time you reach a certain number of boba purchases. I recommend this location over the other Kung Fu Tea locations because the staff is friendlier here, the boba is consistent and it's cheaper here vs if you bought it at the fashion show mall (mall prices make it more expensive there). The amazing art on the wall they have here makes this place unique. The only downside is that it's hard to find parking here, it's always packed.

Went to the front desk to make a walk in  appointment  \"okay well that's going to be an extra charge, unless you want to buy our health care, for a discount\"  this first thing front desk told me. I told them okay I can pay for my doctor's visit, don't worry.  After waiting a few hours they finally saw me and I told the doctor I would like to be tested not only for STDs but also wanted him to tell me what type of infection I had. I get yeast infections when I wear lace underwear or too tight underwear and I had the idea that's what it was. A bacterial infection is what I had. Before finding out this information the doctor let me know that there's a charge for each STD there's a charge to see what kind of infection I had and there's a charge for the pills the health care that I had thought overex most only covered the visit. Not check up and testing. Here's where it gets really interesting after paying for everything he gives me the receipt for the healthcare & paper work with medication name and date on it.  but not the doctor's note saying that he gives has prescribed this medication to me. I just wait they tell me I have everything I need. I checked asking if this is the paperwork I need to get the prescription they say yes. That is the paperwork you will show the pharmacy and the pharmacy you choose . I  go to CVS, Walmart and each one of them tell me the same thing this is only a receipt not a doctor's note. I look around thinking that hey maybe I forgot something nothing to be found in my room no paperwork has been lost. it was finals and I did not have time to keep running around plus I was dealing with a divorce. my time was limited. when I finally go back next year 2016 to tell them that I never got the prescription because I never got the doctor's note saying that he prescribes this medicine to me. The  latina receptionist was so rude called her mangers saying there is a lady saying supposedly she never got her medication. After discrimination my situation and being vary polite. She decided to play 100 questions and tell me this isn't here job hers the help line. I can't help you. Because that \"Dr\"  no longer is working for their department or company. there's no way to get in contact with him too confirm this information. After treating me loke some junkie whos trting to get over on them they give me corporates number. I called ginger, Kerrick, and everybody in the book.  Because they keep giving me to  somebody else's. it gets to the point where I'm getting  talk down to told tough luck you should have got it the year you were prescribed. As if I didn't tell them the story beforehand.which is how I know they weren't listening all they heard was I want money when all I was saying is can I get my medication. I'm sure they'll make a post saying Hey give us a call once again and tell me the same thing. Just like they did before. That it's not their problem and since it's been a couple of months a year now. even though I reported this earlier there's nothing they can do to refund me on anything. honestly now I want a full refund for that supposedly healthcare plan that only lasted till that year was over I bought it in December  and the charges I received for the medication because the doctor didn't do his job .  Corporate  didn't do their jobs. you guys must be hiring anybody willing, till I can find a better job. I was treated like I was crazy for asking where's my dr. Note? Now I didn't even want money until they start talking to me like I was stupid. now I just want my refund I will never recommend my family or friends to such a trashy money-hungry Institution.

We asked if they could be omitted, our server went to the kitchen to ask. When she came back, she said that the pizza toppings for this particular one were \"premixed\" and could not be changed. That was a little disappointing to hear. What else is \"premixed\" here? But we ordered the pizza anyways and picked off the green peppers. As as far as gluten free pizzas go, it was alright. The garlicky flavor went very well with crust.\n\nI do like that they serve iced tea in pitchers. I drink through that stuff like nothing.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

The menu is simple and small which is one thing this location offers: very specific type of drink experience.

A couple other of my favorite joints (Rising Star, Pour, Root Cafe) use organic milk or the local hartzler milk. When making milk based drinks, I personally find milk quality to be almost as important as the roast ans grind if the espresso.

Maybe Monday evening is not the best time to get fresh ingredients from this place. Maybe it was not the right chef there at the moment. Maybe you get mediocre food when you \"take it out\". I have no idea what went wrong, but if the place is consistently good, these factors should not matter, especially when your bill is $88 for 2 (food only).\n\nWhere do we begin? The presentation. I will give them that, almost everything looked neat and appetizing. I know size of sushi maybe a problem for some people, but not for us. We like small pieces with thinly sliced fish. In our mind that is how sushi are supposed to be, not gigantic pieces of thick fish for the added value. There are 2 potential problems here and we had both: freshness of fish and the way their rice is prepared. It was too sticky, too mushy and seemed to be too salty. At least it was not pressed as they usually do at stores (and unfortunately at some restaurants, yuck!) Same applies to the rolls we ordered (btw when a customer insists on no cucumber for both rolls, you repeat it while talking an order, it is a huge disappointment to find cucumber in both rolls!).\nReal crab sushi was too salty for me, ok for my husband. He said Eel sushi was good.\n\nAlbacore Tuna Tataki salad - very fresh greens, nice sauce on a side, thank you for that, but not so fresh tasting albacore tuna! Could not finish it, put it aside after trying one piece. Same thing was with albacore tuna sushi.\nLobster dynamite - a mess of a baked mayo with langostino tails on the bottom (Costco?). If we ignore a huge amount of baked mayo for a second, I  don't understand how you can replace a lobster with langostino tails without letting your customers know. There is a difference, it is not the same, and do not try to convince me otherwise! It is not ethical to call langostino a lobster, and it is not ethical to substitute one with another without letting your customers know (have no idea what was the case, but I suspect the first scenario) Also, please do not put slices of overripen avocado with tiny brown spots on a side - just skip it if you don't have a fresh one.\n\nI do not get all these 5 star yelp reviews for this place. Besides, they do not even have half of the items pictured here from 2013. It is possible that the owner or chefs changed from those glorious times, but I am just speculating at this point.\nOne positive thing Pan Fried Gyoza and Yakisoba were quite tasty, but these dishes are not the main reason I go to a sushi restaurant, fresh fish and properly cooked rice are.\n\nMy husband and I got severe stomach ache the night after eating this dinner. I usually can eat nails and while people around me feel as if they were poisoned, I either feel nothing or very little. This is the first time in a few years I got poisoned. Without this last fact or if we had eaten or drank something else besides this dinner, it would have been 2 stars. Since I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache, it is just 1 star, sorry. In the evening I was willing to give them a second chance, but in the morning I do not feel so generous at all! Waste of our time, energy and money.", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

I feel like the idea is there but the execution was lacking. I had the vegetable taco, al pastor, and the pork adovada. All of them were either lacking in flavor or were spiced too heavily. For example, it tastes like they put a lot of cinnamon in the pork adovada which would be good, but it was just way too much of that flavor. I got flour tortillas which are supposedly homemade but you could have fooled me with that one. Best taco they had was their daily taco it was a smoked chicken taco with a mustard aioli and coleslaw.

Last month, I discover why. Over ten years, many issues of low freon due to countless leaks. We had purchased the full 10 year labor & parts warranty along with Spring & Fall service. At least three, maybe four coils, were replaced along with many leaks during 10 years. Chas Roberts service was excellent then BUT not now! Recently we replaced our builder's system with a new Chas Roberts sold & installed Carrier Infinity HVAC  System. That new system hasn't worked as programmed from the get-go. Here's my opinion: Our builder's duct work installed by Chas Roberts had many issues. Extremely long in a few areas and short in others as it was stretched out too far. Currently they tried to file three claims with Fulton Homes on the duct work THEY installed 11 years ago. All rejected due to age. \n\nThe Carrier Infinity system has a single plenum that has several zones connected to it. We wanted one zone to be at 67 degrees 24/7 during Thanksgiving & Christmas. During those Holidays, the outside night temperature is below 55 degrees. The salesperson clearly stated this system would deliver what we wanted.*** Based upon that statement, I figured the compressor must have a heater on it. The truth is, it didn't! The entire system stalled out waiting for the A/C is run but the compressor's low temperature safety switch prevent it from operating = the heat didn't work until that one zone was cooled off. Wanting to place the blame on the buyer, they repeatedly asked me if I thought both the heat & A/C would run at the same time? With one plenum, both can't run at the same time. Maybe that was their way out to upper Management for this sale gone bad? \n\nChas Roberts blamed me for this entire issue-I expressed an attitude after one month-for that kind of money ($13,464.00) who wouldn't have an attitude? They were annoyed that I questioned their actions. In the end, they removed their system as I did a charge back on AmEx. I purchased a new one zone system from George Brazil-they had to replace the duct work as it was totally destroyed. I can NO LONGER recommend Chas Roberts to anyone since they now have extremely poor customer service, salespersons & a V.P. who does not know or share the correct information on their product, the field staff is poorly trained, + blaming the buyer for any short comings.", "useful": 12, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

The teppanyaki may not be as exciting a show as at other places, but the food is just as tasty and the portions are huge. Prices are within the range for this type of establishment and are almost reasonable in this neighbourhood. The teppanyaki dinners range from $22 for vegetable up to $45 for lobster. The online menu has other teppanyaki options including individual dishes, but they weren't on the menu that we were shown. Had they been, we would have picked one of the individuals ones over the full dinner.\n\nThe five-piece sushi sampler was quite good ($11). Mixed shrimp and veggie tempura was crispy and light, although the tempura mushroom was a bit of a miss.\n\nHot towels to start the meal are a nice touch. The d\u00e9cor is a bit dated. Seating options are the sushi bar, regular tables and teppanyaki tables. The resto is located in Yorkville - one block west of Bay and 1.5 blocks north of Bloor. It's downstairs on the west side of the street.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Mmmmm, delicious boiled meat has been said by no one, ever. \n\nWe used to love the Melting Pot in NC before moving here. Going to this restaurant was an event and you knew you would be dropping some serious $$$ to eat there.  When I saw the Living Social deal for $45 for $75 it seemed like a no brainer and a fun evening out. Boy was I wrong. \n\nTo me, $45 for $75 says they are going to give me a $75 credit for the tab of whatever I order. For a tab that can be close to $200, this seemed like a deal so I bought it. I was surprised when we arrived and was given a \"Prefixed Living Social\" menu instead of a credit on whatever we would like. This, I also noticed, came with smaller portion sizes than what the regular menu came with. So they limit what I can order, but expect me to tip on whatever the full amount would have been without a credit?  We upgraded some of our choices knowing it would be more expensive, but it still didn't make for an enjoyable evening.\n\nThe locations in NC are set up so no booth is right across from another booth, they are kind of staggered for privacy, here felt like we were eating at TGI Fridays. The couple that was set directly across from us had requested a more private table that could not be accommodated and they made a scene. Uncomfortable, to say the least and not the date night I had in mind.\n\nYou better be a fan of garlic to eat here, because aside from the dessert, it's in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you, with instructions of how long to let it \"cook\" as in- if it walks boil two minutes, if it swims boil a minute and  1/2, is less than appetizing. \n\nOur total bill came to $180 (before the $75 credit or tip) and we left disappointed, vowing to never return. Our Living Social Deal also listed we would be given a complimentary champagne toast, which we were not even offered.  I get that we purchased a \"coupon\" but shouldn't be limited to a certain menu or treated any differently from other patrons in the restaurant.  \n\nThis place was not worth the 3 hours we spent there, \"deal\" or not.", "useful": 10, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

The first sales associate who had glasses and had a really pretty shade of grey nail polish on was extremely nice and helpful. However Andrea? the sales associate who decided to take over was incredibly rude and snotty. I asked about samples because I normally order online from Sephora, and even though I had just seen with my own eyes another customer receive a sample, she told me they didn't have any samples available in store except for ones they could make. I honestly didn't even mind that so much, but when I got home and realized that she charged me twice for redeeming a sample (with my points), so now my points balance is -51. I called the store and was put on hold for the longest time, and by then I realized I could just email customer service and hung up. Then I decided to call back for the rude associate's name. Unfortunately I fibbed and said I was trying to give her a compliment instead of a complaint so that they would help me find out her name, and I ended up speaking with the store manager who sounded lovely, and now the store manager is under the impression that Andrea helped me with my customer experience which she did the absolute opposite of. As a previous retail manager I was appalled at her stuck up attitude towards me, which I'm assuming I provoked by interrupting her \"chat\" with her fellow associates to ask her a simple question regarding the Laura Mercier products in the store. And judging by the rest of the reviews left for this location, customer service is apparently a big issue. I will be contacting corporate as well and intend to leave a formal complaint about Andrea, as well as advising them to take a look at this Yelp reviews for this location.

We had read about the great food, and respected the owner's efforts to allow dogs on the patio.  However, on a recent Saturday afternoon, we were greatly disappointed, primarily, but not solely due to the poor service.  After finding a table, we sat waiting for approximately 20 minutes, until I decided to ask the hostess for assistance.  \n\nEn route, a server asked me if I was seated in the corner; and beckoned me to the counter (we had read a review a while back, and recalled that the servers were not permitted on the \"dog\" patio, but didn't know what we were expected to do).   He told me to grab a menu, and walked away.  A while later, he stood at the counter, yelled over, and said that he had forgotten to explain the specifics, namely, we place our order at the counter, and get our own utensils, water, etc.---which was fine, had he done so when we got there, minus the rude demeanor.  \n\nAs for the food, it was disappointing that only the brunch menu was availlable, but we managed to find a few items, which were just ok.  I'm guessing that dishes, glassware, etc. are not allowed because of the dogs, but food served on a paper plate without a side dish or even a garnish was very unappealing.  Our breakfast burrito was also cold, and for almost $10, should have come with something other than sauce.\n\nCocktails were also a joke.  I guess beer is the thing here, but we ordered mixed drinks and mimosas, which came in plastic cups barely larger than a dixie cup, and were definitely overpriced.\n\nWe are generally pretty easygoing, and don't tend to complain, but I have to agree with another reviewer that you feel like you have the plague in the dog area.  The waiter seemed put out that he had to deal with us, and at one point, another server ran in and grabbed some items left behind, and ran out, as though she might catch something.  \nThe final straw occured while I was waiting to pay the bill; our waiter presented a couple of large dog bones to the customers' dog right next to me, but didn't offer our pup a thing...I guess she didn't rate either!!

Although I am new to writing an official review on Yelp, my husband and I are no stranger to frequenting a variety of top restaurants in Toronto and around the world for that matter.  Last night was our first time at Cluny and we were both very excited to try it out.  When we walked in, we were immediately impressed with the quaint French bistro d\u00e9cor and overall feel and ambiance.  Loved the little bakery at the front of the restaurant.  When we arrived, we were not greeted by anyone (restaurant wasn't even busy at this point 6:45 Monday evening), after about 5 mins of standing there looking around, someone that looked like he was one of the Chefs (who happened to be getting something in the stock room/closet, finally said someone will be with you shortly.  We were greeted by the hostess with a less than impressive hello.  After we were seated, it took about 10mins before we were acknowledged by our Waiter for the evening.  Again, was not impressed by his demeanor and lack of interest in us as guest.  We've probably had better service at a local Chain restaurant or a drive thru for that matter!  Our appetizers came relatively quickly (Oysters, Cod balls and Caesar salad).  The Caesar salad was a complete disappointment, perhaps I had high expectations but when you proudly call a dish \"Cluny Caesar\" with a price tag of $13+ I would expect a little more than 2 branches of Romaine barely drizzled with dressing and 4-5 chick peas and feta lining the bottom.  We ordered Oysters and when it was  brought to us, the Waitress was trying to explain the different Oysters and said \"Oh and I forget what this one is called....\" Anyway, I don't want to get too lengthy with the review here but all in all I would rate the food quite good (minus the Caesar salad) at this restaurant but the underwhelming service takes this place to a whole new low.  The atmosphere in terms of d\u00e9cor and ambiance were excellent, very reminiscent of a bistro in Paris which is a rare find here.  The service was beyond below average.  Our waiter (middle aged male, appeared quite sloppy if I can be honest) was inattentive, unpleasant and simply unprofessional.  He did not check on us until our dinner was done and did not even utter a \"Thanks or good bye\" when we paid the bill.  This is definitely a very poorly managed establishment with very disengaged, unprofessional/untrained staff, you can see it in their demeanor and even the way they are dressed. I think the hostess was wearing running shoes and some other waiters were dressed in black golf shirts or sports bra like gym attire.  I am disappointed because this place has potential.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Sushi should never be fishy.  Fishy fish is scary and gross but the sweet taste of the sea is always good.  So I waited to come here twice before writing my review.  The first visit happened on good old Boxing Day, December 26th, 2015.  After a long day of retail therapy, we settled in for a nice meal of dead fish.  Their menu is overwhelming, informative, and full of all sorts of goodies you could possibly want --- from Happy Hour to dinner bentos, they have whatever tickles your fancy.  We shared a Samurai Plate (20pc sashimi plate + 6pc nigiri] for $34.95, their specialty Lollipop Roll for $11.95, a Dragon Roll for $10.95, and 2pc. uni for $11.95.  \n\nThe sashimi for our Samurai plate was cut even and tasted fresh.  The white tuna and salmon were our favorite bites from our sashimi plate and the 6pc nigiri was a nice accompaniment.  The albacore nigiri made me almost want to order more but we had other dishes coming.  So you can't go to Yanagi and not get the Lollipop Roll.  It's your basic cucumber roll with fish and imitation crab meat, sans the rice.  You won't miss not having rice because it tastes fresh.  The Dragon Roll isn't anything fancy and was ordered more as an afterthought.  I wish we ordered a different specialty roll but we just wanted some good old unagi.  Gotta love the eel with some tempura shrimp for some nice crunchy texture.  As for the uni, it was fresh and creamy.  It tasted of the sea and if kissing a mermaid was possible, that's probably what this uni tasted like.\n\nOur second visit, just last night, held much a much similar experience as far as food goes.  It was fresh, fish was buttery, and I was happy with my meal.  Even when my eyes were welling up with tears from wasabi or something in the Hawaiian Volcano Roll, I was content.  I liked it.  So why the three stars?\n\nThis place is more on the 4-stars mark because of their friendly staff and service but I got to dock a star.  It's a quaint cozy restaurant with lots to offer and the food is decent but I'm docking a star because of a miscommunication on their part.  Twice.  On both visits:\n\n- First visit:  I tried to pay half of the meal with my newly obtained Christmas giftcard and the other part on my debit. The $40 giftcard is new so I'm guessing the card withheld 20% of the funds or whatnot because it only ran $33-something instead of $37-something. Yanagi tried to split the bill between the two and ran my debit first and the giftcard only ran for partial amount. The difference was like $4.29. It wasn't a big deal and I said I'll pay the difference in cash so they won't have to run my debit card again  [I honestly was trying to be considerate and not have them be charged again to run my card for a measly $4-something]. Upon checking my bank statement three days later, I noticed they had charged the $4.29 on my card anyways. It's not a big deal but we're talking a +5% increase on their tip which I could be all for but I wish they told me. This could have just been a miscommunication but ehh. I was just trying to make their life easier by paying the partial in cash so they don't get charged again for running my card. I even told the waitress I'll be paying that part in cash and we showed her the $5 that covered missing funds from the giftcard BEFORE we left. I ain't gonna make a stink over $4 but very lame, Yanagi!\n\n- Second visit:  Only one person paid for the whole bill and the birthday girl had RSVP'd on the Yelp app.  Once again, there was drama about their card.  I'm starting to think it has something to do with their machine.  I won't go into details since I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the card and/or card reader but after we paid and were leaving, I was pulled aside by the boss-lady.  She decided to lecture me how they don't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays and I stood there awkwardly because I wasn't even the one that rsvp'd.  Had I known that it was done through the Yelp app, I would have told her that.  So I stood there being lectured when by all means she had a full restaurant to tend to and I wasn't sure if I was suppose to apologize.  Our reservation was at 6pm when it was slow. We would have been seated with no problem anyways. We all ordered food, even multiple items, so they made a solid dime off of us so I don't know why I was being lectured. I walked away confused.\n\nSo yes, come here for excellent food but I advise you to pay in cash to avoid any drama with their card machine.  Also, no reservations Fridays & Saturdays or you'll get yelled it.  Boom.", "useful": 61, "funny": 39, "cool": 52}

In the past, the food was decent and the management of staff and service wasn't particularly bad either. However, in recent months, I have experienced tremendous decline in their service and quality of food.\n\nWhen we sat down at our table, we asked for three cups of water and subsequently ordered our dish. I believe we waited for 10 minutes before any server even approach us (clearly they have forgotten the drinks). Later, we observed and noticed that the table next to us already got their food, even when they arrived later than us. We asked for water again, and took another 6 minutes before the servers finally brought them to our table. When we asked for the bill, I was raising my hand for a good 5 minutes before any server notices me. Let's be clear: This restaurant isn't big at all and they had four servers in total. Clearly, the servers or management weren't efficient at all.\n\nFood quality: My mom had a cow tongue dish with rice. The meat was very hard and over-cooked. The dish was supposed to be baked but it turned out to be under-baked. I had unagi spaghetti pasta. As you may have guessed, the unagi had bone in it. \n\nNot all is lost, the pasta spaghetti itself was good. Unfortunately, the quality of service made the whole dining experience down the drain.

Clearly I wasn't part of the cool kids club offering up 5 stars. \n\nMy former movers had to move my scheduled move so I was in a bind and Chris was available to help me. \n\nThe estimate provided (while on the pricier side) was straight forward after reading the fine print. \n\nEverything seemed fine ... dispatcher called and said they would be there between 1 and 2. I told him I had originally planned it for 9-10 start time with Chris he told me that time was book ed and this is what they could offer. No big deal ... I understand this is on the fly and I appreciated them being able to schedule me at all. \n\nNow come the day of ... \n\nOne of their movers calls me (he was professional) and says his morning move was canceled and he was heading over -- its just after 9am. I tell him that I had not planned on them being there until 1 at the earliest and I made a morning meeting but could be there closer to 11.  He told me to just call the office then because he can't wait that long. \n\nSo ... I call the office and tell them that won't work because I won't be there til closer to 11 as I wasn't expecting them til 1 as dispatched.  The guy on the phone had the nerve to tell me that's the dispatcher gives tentative times as he can't please everyone's schedule. So I tell him well earliest I can do is 11.  He says fine we'll send a different crew at noon. Sweet deal I will be there. \n\nNoon ... NO movers.  12:30 I call and the guy from earlier tells me he will find out where crew #?? is and call me right back.  12:50 - Me calling again and I get Chris (I think sweet - This guy will care he's my sales guy) well let me tell you ... Sale stopped after I have my credit card number. He basically is like well you couldn't accommodate  the schedule given so today so you have to wait.  I tried to explain what happen (from the morning) and he cut me off telling me \"They're on their way.\" \n\nThen this booger ... HUNG UP ON ME!!\n\nAnyhow, 3 (Shawn, Liddel and Ricky) movers come and they are hustling - So all the timing issues are out the window because I am so impressed with these guys. \n\nBut then progress starts slowing down as they approach the hour mark. \n\nNow I can only see two (Liddel and Ricky) movers hauling ass ... But the 3rd guy is missing. \n\nNow I can hear the quiet rumble (outdoors) of movers holding each other accountable for hauling ass and getting this done.\n\nAll the stuff is packed and we are on our way to the new house. \n\nWe supposedly left the same time - Now I understand their truck might be slower than my Honda - but come on ... almost an hour drive time?!  That you pay for double?! It took me 20 minutes?! \n\nSo I get past that because I just want this to be over with. \n\nNow the guys are tired - I see it on their faces. \n\nI hear them talking about how many hours a day they work. \n\nI feel bad so I tell them no worries just toss it here and there. \n\nDude ... the hustle was real. Straight up they were moving at double time speed. \n\nWell 2/3 of them are.  Legit - Liddel and Ricky are hauling butt yet being so careful.  The other guy is keeping a steady pace. I assume he is the supervisor or something he had that air about him - Plus he had the official clipboard. \n\nSo, the last is finished.  Time to pay up.  I offer my cc, sign away the contract times. Gripe about the double drive time. \n\nOffer the guys beverages and thank them for their services.  Liddel and Ricky are thanking me for choosing Move 4 Less; making sure I don't need help with anything additional as they finished closing the truck up.  \n\nThey wish me well and are on their way. \n\nShort story long would I recommend Move 4 Less or use them again ... I don't know.  I certainly wouldn't work with Chris as my sales guy.  I would definitely request Liddel and Ricky as my movers.

(I have a corporation too but I can't charge my clients 10 or 20 times what my products and services are worth. \n\nFinally Dan got on the line and said he'd refund the service fee and that Eric must have quoted the wrong prices. I find that difficult to believe since Eric looked ashamed and said he can't do anything about the prices the company sets. We both knew he had attempted to rip me off and was unsuccessful. I don't think Eric is a rogue employee that cooks up crazy estimates without the company knowing about it. \n\nStay away from these thieves!", "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 1}

The weather was perfect- not too cold and no rain ;)\n\nThanks to (1st) reviewer Brent C.'s recommendation on entering westbound towards 7th Street to park.  We parked at a neighborhood street with no issues.  It's preferable to park there than a business parking lot because of fear of being towed; just don't block somebody's driveway or park too close to it. \n\nArrive a half-hour before the parade's start time @ 7 PM and there should be somewhere to park (free).  We walked a short distance about a block away on 7th St towards Indian School Rd.  We chose the end of the parade route that's on Indian School because vehicles and floats may stop off past the route's end off Indian School, where you could have photo ops up-close before they dismantle.  Our favorite was the guy who was at the back of his vehicle shooting out 'real snow flakes' into the air that eventually flurried down around us like it's beginning to snow, which coincided with the winter wonderland theme- I felt like I was filming a Hallmark channel Christmas movie ;)  Such a fun highlight of the parade that made it worth showing up.\n\nWe found a great spot at the corner of 7th / Indian School to view the parade and for photographing/videoing.  There were vehicles, floats, bands, dancers all displaying or wearing lights.  There were large balloons, too.  The parade lasted about a couple hours.\n\nThe only negative thing is too many officials circling all over the parade and obstructing the view; some even seemed to be hanging around and standing in front of parade-goers without a thought of moving over a little bit.  The growing crowd of people was not too bad, as long as there was no squeezing (it would've been a lot more sensible to have left the grouchy babies/toddlers & (fat) strollers at home).\n\nThis year's them was \"Winter Nights, Dazzling Lights\", which I liked because winter wonderland is always breathtaking.  Each float / group had a number and were judged the day before and awarded for best float.  Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton (who is an alumnus at my alma mater, Cortez High School) was present.  No, former sheriff Joe Arpaio was not there.  The parade capped with the one and only Santa Claus waving at the crowds as he was sitting atop the fire truck.\n \nCity of Phoenix Parks & Recreation is in charge of the parade.  ABC-TV used to air it live and eventually pre-empts at another date.  You can also view on on YouTube (with cc), which they uploaded a few hours after the parade ended.  Up until the Light Rail was built, the parade used to roll down Central Ave exclusively, which I liked and miss.\n\nOn the previous day from 5:30 PM to 8 PM, you may stop by North Phoenix Baptist Church parking lot and watch the judging of the floats for awards and  the prepping up the floats with the lights.\n\nFor more details on the parade, rules, and entry sample: https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/special-events/electric-light-parade\n\nHave fun next year should you decide to go (after being armed with plenty of information ) ;)\n\nBTW, I thought of paritcipating in this parade back in the 1990s with my dog, after spotting the Dalmation Club of AZ, under the non-profit therapy dog program.  The woman in charge to whom I submitted this idea was either too lazy to \"plan big\" or didn't want to be in the cold.  Boo.  Needless to say, I let my membership with her group lapse :(", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1}

I was sooo looking forward to this event but I have to admit I made some assumptions and that's my fault.  The venue when I walked in was just beautiful.  I walked around a bit and admired the decor.  I assumed it was a sit down type event and so I found a seat at the long table in the back and waited for the event to start.  When I realized it was more of a mix and mingle I got up and wandered around to catch up with people I hadn't seen in awhile.  My 2nd mistake was assuming that \"brunch\" meant a full on meal.  As Johnson pointed out... It started at 1 which should have been my clue that it wouldn't have been an event to fill up.  However I did not clue in and showed up relatively hungry.   Although seated at a table for the majority of the event I can't say I was privileged to try all the samples that came out.  There just wasn't enough and they were devoured the instant the plate touched the table.  I was finally fortunate to try a slice of pizza which was nice.  At one point I just sat and watched as each plate that was delivered was devoured like a pack of hungry animals had gotten to it.  I was thoroughly impressed when I saw someone managed to upload albeit blurry photo of a pizza to the event page.  How did that happen? \n\nI don't know if I was able to get a sense for what the restaurant has to offer by the samples that i did taste. I thought the decor was stunning and I would want to come back to enjoy dining at Mangia & Bevi, but honestly can't say that I know the food is good as I didn't really get a good taste of what it is they offer.  \n\nMy only suggestion for a future event like this is to advise us to eat in advance.  There is always one slow person like me that didn't clue in to the sample sizes.  \n\nThank you Chantal for organizing and Kris for back up.  I hope you managed to try some samples yourself.", "useful": 7, "funny": 4, "cool": 5}

Can a hot dog be gussied up enough to elevate it to gourmet?  That remains to be seen.  But it seems like the Station Street Hot Dog place is taking a crack at it.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, it's a 1970's retro building - all open with high ceilings, so the noise level can be high when there's a lot of people there and the staff is prepping potatoes for the fryer.\n\nNot a place to linger, either, just rows of stools on counters that line the periphery of the restaurant.  As an aside, I went on a very rainy, cold Saturday and the place was nearly full.  Sousa brothers, if you're listening, please re-configure the floor space to allow for more seating (Kevin's wife did tell me that plans are in place to add a deck for seasonal seating).\n\nYou go up to the counter and order.  Menu is very basic.  When asked if there are plans to expand, Mrs. Sousa (sorry I did not catch her name) said that a Chicago style is being considered but \"Kevin wanted to do it right\".  If you don't like fries, you're out of luck, that's the only side.  There's the choice of fountain drinks or Mexican Coca-Cola.  I'd be nice to have other options such as Root Beer from East End brewing or other locally-produced soft drink.  Or Jones Soda if local isn't an option.\n\nI got the Chili Dog and my friend got the Chili Dog and a New York Dog.  We split an order of fries (not cooked in duck fat).  The hot dog is very high quality, a tad bit bigger than what you get at Frankuary, for example, and had a nice spice and snap.  The chili was unremarkable and not spicy hot.  A disappointment.  The spices I discerned in the chili were cumin and maybe nutmeg, with chili powder WAY in the background.  Maybe so it wouldn't clash with the spices in the hot dog?\n\nThe cheese was curiously cut into cubes, so there were three \"pockets\" of cheese in the sandwich rather than cheese throughout, which is what you get using shredded cheese.  The buns were okay and extremely unremarkable.  A step or two up from grocery store buns, but they were fresh.  \n\nThe fries were undersalted, which was okay, since there was salt on the table and preferable to being oversalted.  It was a large-ish portion but again, nothing spectacular.  A very friendly fellow customer offered me a few of his duck fat fried fries, and like many of the other reviewers, I couldn't tell the difference between the duck and non-duck fries.\n\nMy friend liked his NY hot dog.  The person at the counter said that the sauerkraut was homemade, but the uniform cut and taste of the cabbage suggested store-bought.\n\nAs hot dog places go, this I liked but didn't love.  I thought $5 was a reasonable price to pay for a hot dog and $3 for the fries was also reasonable, given the portion size.  If you're on the east end and have a hankering for a hot dog, I'd give it a try.  But I wouldn't go out of your way to go here.  Other places (Dee's Six Packs, Frankuary, even the O) give you the same quality at about the same price.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

I did find it odd that my room was skipped by housekeeping on one of these days (I didn't put the Do Not Disturb tag on my door either).

Cocktail shrimp was plump and fresh, fruits all ripe, and I generally had no qualms with the quality of any of the offerings.\n\nThe service was impeccable! With folks manning the chafing dishes and opening the lids for me, the easy going yet attentive wait staff, and someone who I imagine was in management offering a free customized cocktail to the birthday girl in the group, I felt really taken care of. 5 stars PLUS for the level of service by the staff =)\n\nSomething weird to note was that every half hour or so, the ground beneath us would vibrate. My guess is that it might have something to do with a water pump or filtration system for the newly renovated pool area right next to the restaurant.\n\nMy experience here and at Nikki Beach has me way impressed with the \"new\" Tropicana.", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 3}

My first experience was back in July of 2017, they moved me from a three bedroom to a 4 bedroom. I didn't include my garage that had ten boxes and some metal racks and bikes. Anyhow Chris I believe was the guy who set me up, There was 2 movers and 1 foreman that showed up to move me, and were on time. These guys were on point, even though I am a talker they just kept moving while the pretended to conversate with me. I didn't mind cause they were there to move me and they did just that. I think they moved me just under or a bit past 3 hrs, have to check my receipt. Any how these three guys were on their game, knew what they were doing. They wrapped what had to be wrapped and maintained pace. Only damage were the handles on my king size mattress , it could of been avoided but then it again I think that was more on beauty rest co for not making them strong enough, so I didn't make a big deal. Fast fwd. to December 2017 had to move again, didn't hesitate to hire them again from the great experience though their hrly rate is higher then others. Sad to say I wasn't as pleased as the first time, they took 5+ hrs and change or so, the dropped and broke one of my night stands, it's second hand so didn't make a big deal again. Though this time I added my garage I thought it would only add an additional hr and I did move a bit farther. This time I got two guys a foreman and a helper, the foreman was good but the helper seemed to be a bit of a hold up (much respect to those guys, moving is tough work). However point I am trying to make is that I  didn't experience the consistency I was looking for, might be moving again this summer, I am afraid I will have to consider the competition.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

I came here for lunch, on a Wednesday afternoon, with a friend. Prior to coming here, I had read some reviews saying how they sometimes get so packed, that even at 1pm, there is a fairly long wait. Upon arrival, i was actually getting a little scared considering i had to park on the south end of the parking lot and walk over. \n\nLUCKILY ! Nope, no wait time XD super lucky i was told by my friend. I called her my lucky charm :P haha \n\nDecor is very different. \"Clean\" and bright, yet simple. Bright colors with live vegetation (live flowers and containers filled with fruit) and decor. Different lighting and textures. It was quite nice on the eyes. Really different from what you'd usually see in a traditional restaurant. \n\nThis restaurant is based on the traditional Jamaican/Caribbean flavors with New Mexican cuisine. I don't know much about New Mexican cuisine but what i remembered of Caribbean is their huge use of spice (flavors) and SPICE (HEAT!) \n\nA lot of reviews had talked about like the New Mexican Style slow-cooked pork, or chicken and waffles (not traditional chicken but JERK chicken!), or other things. \n\nWe were seated in the side room (to the right upon entry). \n\nSuper nice waitress and briefly described how their items are on the spicier side but can be changed, if preferred. HECK NO!  bring it on spice XD ! haha\n\nMy friend and I ordered two things, and shared off each other's plates. She had ordered the New Mexican Style slow-cooked pork, whereas I had ordered the Jamaican curry chicken. \n\nI was actually amazed by the portion size. I am not a small eater, i couldn't even finish half. Ended up having to box up BOTH orders because BOTH were only half eaten. AND we shared ! LOL \n\nBOTH were served in a bowl (obviously since it was under the \"DW House Bowls\" section) but the best thing... BOTH WERE PIPING HOT ! YES ! \n\nNew Mexican-style slow cooked pork (simmered in New Mexican red chile with two over-easy eggs served over rice) - $12\n\nVERY heavy and hearty dish. Comes with two? three? small tortillas on the side. This is how i described it to my friend. \"It is a dish where is good on a nice cold night, sitting next to a fire, with a book\". Heavy and hearty to keep you warm through the cold night. Good idea right? Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs on top, spilling its rich ooey gooey goodness over the slow-cooked simmered pork in red chile. Spice level, mild? There IS a bit of spice in it. Would prefer a bit more but it wasn't bad as it was. The meat was tender and pulled apart fairly easily. The included small tortillas allow you to make these small burrito wraps yourself. Another thing i told my friend... \"if only we had some like corn salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese.. this would be a YUMMY burrito !\" haha =X \n\nJamaican curry chicken (sauteed seasonal vegetables; served over rice or couscous) - $12 \n\nIn comparison to the slow cooked pork dish, this dish is light and bright. Light curry flavor, with little to no spice, but refreshing from the sauteed seasonal veggies that give it a bright flavor amongst the curry taste. It's a pretty good combination. Veggies were like cubed zucchini, green beans, two different types of mushrooms, etc  The chicken is a little overcooked, so a little tough (considering it was white meat as well). Still pretty good though. I later regretted asking for rice over couscous. I wonder how it would have been with couscous. Very curious now. \n\nOverall. Pretty good experience. $12 for a bowl i cant even finish? Pretty good ! Flavors are good. Would like to try other things next time. \n\nLittle additional uhm... thing.. haha (lack of vocab coming to my head at the moment)... the boxes they give you to pack leftovers... THEY ARE STURDY AND MICROWAVABLE ! (super chinese but most likely reusable) XD", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1}

Third time here and I left disappointed.  Thought I would give Chile Bravo my business and fill the homesickness void I have felt (food wise) since I left my native California.  I ordered Shrimp Tacos because they are always succulent and a great source of flavor if done right.  The waitress gets back to me telling me they don't offer them anymore because they are changing some items on the menu. Fair enough, so I ordered the chalupa with enchilada, rice and beans dish.  My husband ordered the Gallo Special which sounded a lot more delicious than what it looked or was.  His Gallo Special was a thin steak doused in white cheese and overcooked shrimp on top which were also smothered in white cheese. You can tell when shrimp is overcooked when it has curled inward all the way.  My dish consisted of a plate of you guessed it, the same white melted cheese with shredded lettuce and tomato on top with rice and beans with more melted white cheese.  I don't ever recall Mexican food ever having this much cheese.  And honestly, I love cheese but never this much? I can't even believe I'm saying this.  It was pretty bland too.  I guess I'm just disappointed and hope the chefs can come up with better dishes that resemble the more authentic taste of what Mexican cuisine is.  There is much room for improvement so I'm going to stay hopeful.  Will check back in a few months.", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2}

Even when our server was with us, she wasn't very attentive which created order mishaps. It was nothing serious, but the whole experience was displeasing. It reminded me why I haven't been to any PT's establishment in almost four years.\n\nTheir food has usually been decent and I'm typically content with the dishes (obviously sticking to the traditional bar food), but service has always been so shoddy!

That wasn't the case as they only had one customer in the patio. When I asked the hostess how long it will be, she probably realised the pointless wait and directed us to 1 of 6 free tables. \n\nWhen we got to the table, it was dirty with specs of leftover pizza from the precious dining. Our waitress was not very helpful either when asked for recommending  vegetarian pizzas. The water which was brought to us was in filthy glasses and we had to send one of them back. The pizzas took more than 30 mins, which seemed a bit much for a couple of regular pizzas. We were told things are hectic between 3-5pm and that the oven was an old type which made things lesser efficient than the ones in Tempe. \n\nWhen the pizza finally arrived, it was ok.

First project we worked on was about 8 months ago when we designed our dream his and hers master closets.  2nd project was just recently completed in March and included Custom TV/ENT built in cabinet inside empty TV hatch left by builder on 1st floor, also Wine rack and dry-bar built in as well as huge custom book shelf in our loft area.  \n\nDuring our design phases CC designer Jeff and owners Matt and Debbie were on top of it all the time.  Jeff is very outspoken and great to work with and have presented us with several options for our master closets out of which we picked and tweaked the one we like the most. After his drawings were completed and sent for our approval Debbie ensured timely installation.  She assigned us with one of her best installers Jose who shortly after proven why is he the best.  He was right on time, actually even earlier then scheduled.  Jose is very neat and professional and wastes no time and his work was spot on.  Jose and his helper cleaned and vacuumed the work area after being done with install and polished our new closets.  Ah that smell they used kept smelling so good for weeks.  We were very happy with entire process, fair price, and professionalism by entire crew of CC.  Also, during design phase owners of this branch of CC opened their doors to their own house that had pretty much any custom work you could think off so that we can choose what we like the most.   They became more than business owners to us, they became our friends.  \n\nBecause our such a positive experience and results with first project we proceeded with design stages and getting bids for our 2nd larger project for TV ENT shelf, wine rack/dry bar and huge bookshelf.  Very quickly did we realize that others were not even able to do what we envisioned and we have called them back again.  This time we had to wait for 8 weeks for the install.  We requested Jose again and boy did he not disappoint.  Again, perfect and early, on time, professional, great hard worker.  He actually managed to do 2 days worth of work in one 10 hour day.   it was my honor to cook and reward them with some of my specialties at the end of the night they finished.   As we had some remaining questions for some minor items for the shelf he made sure that owner himself comes into our home and answer any questions. Matt sure did exactly that and more and we were once again more than happy with results. \n\nWe would be more than happy to hire CC again for any of our custom wood work needs.\n\nSincerely,\nMilosevic Family", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Maybe, this excitement was what kept me coming back after my first bizarre visit and two more mediocre lunch visits.\n\nI'm glad I kept coming back, because this last visit was a winner! I walked in today and told them, \"I want to try something on your menu that is Afghan and packs a punch of flavor.\" I believe he took this as a challenge, and recommended the Quorma Sabze with Beef. I added on an order of Bolani, which I'd had before, but wanted to give a second try.\n\nWhile waiting for the orders, I received some Hummus and Pita. The hummus was tangy and flavorful, though not as smooth as it could have been.\n\nIt took a bit longer than it should have to receive the Bolani, considering I was the only person in the cafe, but it was worth the wait. Now I've had Bolani before. I've even had it before at Ariana's, but this was leagues better than the last one I tried here. The dough was thinner and crisped up nicely, and the filling was packed full of flavor. Lots of onion, scallion, leek, cilantro and potatoes to glue it all together. It was served with a Green Chutney, which tasted extremely fresh and acidic, and also a yogurt sauce which had some of the chutney mixed into it.\n\nShortly after the Bolani arrived, the Quorma made it to the table. I'm a bit suspicious that this was the Quorma Sabze we had talked about, because that dish is supposed to feature spinach and herbs, but this dish was very tasty. The beef, cauliflower and chickpeas were cooked in a loose, sweet onion based tomato sauce that had a peppery finish. The rice was cooked well and the chickpeas were tender, but the beef was a little tough for my liking. Even with that minor complaint, I would order this dish again.\n\nI feel like Ariana's is finally starting to hit their groove. If they can iron out the dining experience a bit more, they'll be much better off than they are. The layout of the restaurant is confusing. There is a large menu board in the back, no one to greet you when you walk in, one solitary color menu and the rest bad blurry black and white copies. I feel like the crew at Ariana's should embrace the flavor-filled Afghan cuisine, and guide diners enthusiastically to try it. I know I'm eager to go back and try more.\n\nFull review available at  http://forkvsfood.com/?p=69", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

We got these:\n1)Shepherd's Biscuit piled high with meats and eggs\n2)Pumpkin quinoa porridge with almond milk\n3) House hash\n4) Smoked salmon and trout with radishes, capers, red onions, spinach with a balsamic vinegar dressing, and tomatoes, along with a cheese lavosh (which looked like a thin cracker)--loved the deconstructed presentation of my other  food love, which is the same stuff but served on a toasted everything bagel! \n4) for drinks--brewed green iced tea, coffee (delish!) and served with cream, and brown sugar or with Stevia \n5) a chocolate croissant--just because. \n\nSet us back around $50.00, but basically we did order food worthy of four people  \n\nIn the end, I managed to take but three tablespoonfuls of my porridge--yeah, after finishing off my fish platter, I was done for. I was super full! \n\nFinal verdict--will return ASAP! The Japanese-like simple elegance of the food plating is impressive. By the way, the chef is Bosnian, and he knows good good and from the looks of it, art as well. They've been around for two years only. I want them to last for as long as possible.

I really do. You just make it so hard for me, sometimes. \n\nI've been coming to Angkor off an on for several years now. I found them through Restaurant.com, a service that offers discounted dining certificates for partnered restaurants in the area. The first visit, I only went there because I could use the certificates, but over time I found myself enjoying the place more and more.\n\nThere are few restaurants more attractive than Angkor, especially located in a strip mall. When diners walk in, the first thing they probably notice are the carved, gilded walls. It's not a huge dining room, but the tables are spaced apart nicely and the decor is top notch. It's very, very attractive inside. I've been there a dozen times or more now and each time I walk through the door I'm struck by the beauty of the place.\n\nThe menu is decent, and the prices are not too extravagant. I think the problem lies in availability and service. \n\nMy boyfriend loves their haw mook, a shredded fish steamed with coconut milk and curry in a banana-leaf cup. We used to drive across the city sometimes just so he could have it, and more than once we showed up on a Friday or Saturday evening to find out they weren't serving it that night. I completely understand that weekends are incredibly busy and stressful in the restaurant business, but it's listed on the menu as a regular item. The last time we were there, two or three weeks ago, we were told the haw mook is made in advance and when they run out, it's gone for the night. Wouldn't it make sense to list this on the menu as subject to availability, the way seasonal items are listed as market price on other restaurant menus? A sidebar marking on the menu may be enough of a warning to convince people to call ahead before showing up, instead of assuming it is a constant like we did. After the first two \"sorry, we don't have that tonight,\" replies we finally asked about it and were told about the advance preparation. \n\nWe've also gone here with other couples several times, and have been disappointed by the service. I've made reservations (more than once) that were lost, and twice now we've ordered food that's taken upwards of an hour to receive, even when we were one of a handful of groups in the restaurant. If I have to go out for dinner during the weekend, I do so either very early or after a dinner rush, so I'm not making a nuisance of myself or stressing out the servers, and still we've gotten mediocre service at Angkor. Once, over the summer, all of our dishes were served except my boyfriend's, and he had already been turned down over the haw mook. After deciding on something else, his order was apparently lost. We had to eat before him while he waited for his meal to be made, and this was after waiting at least forty minutes (possibly more) for ours. All in all it took over two hours to order, eat and manage to pay our bill. \n\nI love the food at Angkor. I've never been disappointed with anything I've chosen. The tilapia dishes are excellent (when they have them, as they've run completely out of it before, in addition to the premade haw mook), as are all of the noodle and curry options. Unfortunately, sometimes I've had to jump through hoops or exercise extreme patience in order to receive dinner. \n\nWe've found several places closer that serve haw mook on a regular basis and have never let us down, so we most likely won't be going out of our way to visit Angkor again. However, if I'm in the area I'll still stop in. The food's worth it, so long as the place isn't busy. If I lived closer to the city, I'd make a habit of coming here on the weekday evenings to avoid any issues, but that's not an option for me now. I'll be reserving Angkor for the occasional in the neighborhood treat from now on.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Probably because they have the best burger in Pittsburgh.  I am sure that statement can be met with disapproval, and I don't care.  These bar side made burgers are so good!  I have yet to have a burger cooked there that wasn't cooked incredible perfect and to my requested standards, seasoned wonderfully and was so full of flavor.   Their candied jalapeno burger served medium rare is my favorite and I get it every time I come.  I also really enjoy their shrimp and grits, actually the BEST shrimp and grits I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked grits, not hard or gritty, with a habanera cheese sauce, topped with broiled shrimp.  So delicious.\n\nI need to point out that my first visit to Benjamin's was for a Yelp event last year.  I am so happy they had that event and I got to attend, because otherwise I don't think I would have ever tried this place.  \n\n\nNow since they lack any fryers and the kitchen is literally on the corner of the bar (IE the oven, prep, plates) their side dishes are all raw minus the bacon home fries.  I don't mind this at all, I prefer something a little healthier to go with my most likely 800 calorie burger, but I wish the sides were a little more inventive, and I wish they offered a salad as well.  Last time I tried the broccoli salad as my side.  Eh it was ok.  The broccoli was nice, crunchy, and vibrant but the sauce and other components lacked flavor.  I also had their pasta salad and potato salad.  The pasta salad was my favorite of the three but still wish there were some other options for sides.  \nI must also mention, they have a Brunch with a Bloody Mary Bar on Saturday and Sundays, and offer daily drink specials, on top of their Monday through Friday Happy Hour specials which you can get $2.00 off your draft choice.

I could see it being a great place to go for after dinner drinks.The wine and beer selections are pretty good, although overpriced--a draft of Blue Moon was $6, which seems ridiculous to me. I can't speak for the food, having never eaten there, but I saw some small plates set out for a party and they looked delicious. The bad? The average age of the crowds I have seen there has got to be in the mid-50s. This is definitely a more \"mature\" bar, which can be nice, but also can be kind of cringey if you are 21-40ish and you don't want to watch older folks get their groove on, ie, it feels like a wedding where you watch your Aunt Linda get tipsy and grind on your Uncle Ted. Also, the bartenders look right at you, see that you are waiting, and then walk away. The other night I waited a good 10 minutes just to get a wine list, and the place wasn't even that crowded. I want to like Vosh. I really do. It's a nice higher-end bar, which is rare in Lakewood, but the atmosphere is just too weird.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

However, it was good if you like mushrooms and caramelized onions.  Did seem to taste even better the next day!\n\nSmall 'white' pizza was $16 and I was only able to eat half, the rest was takeout.

Most meat options were pork, although staff did say that there were able to remove toppings that you didn't want.\n\nStaff was nice, although I felt like they were hovering as there were at least 2-3 waiters for this tiny restaurant.  I was asked how everything was 3Xs during my 30-45min stay.

Walking in you can already tell from the left over partially full dishes previous patrons have left (not only food but full plates of desert). Ordered the Cheesy Japanese Curry Baked Rice as well as the Unagi Cheesy Baked Rice. Both were equally horrible tasteless lack of sauce dry and worst of all the Unagi is NOT fresh and tastes funny, never eaten chewy unagi before with a wierd fishy plastic taste. The rice was under cooked and hard. We also ordered the hk style rice noodles which were again undercooked and the hoisin and peanut sauces were so watered down they had no taste nor did it stick to the rice noodles. Talk about skimping. To top it off the size of their bowls/plates are 20% smaller which hardly makes up for the price.\n\nPrice - This brings me to the price. The size of the bowls are 20% smaller yet the pricing at this place is almost 30% more expensive! $9 for a similar type of baked rice dish anywhere in the east end they are selling for $12 in a 20% smaller size. IF it tasted good I could justify but not in this case. On top of it all the resturant is cash only *facepalm* I wonder why.. *rolls eyes*. $9 for a bowl of hk style sweet tofu desert LOL what does it have in there gold on flakes? The same desert is under $5 in the east end. For 2 people we ended up with a $40 bill ordering only 2 rice dishes and an appetizer leaving unsatisfied and still hungry. \n\nService - While the waitresses are really nice the service in food delivery is extremely slow. You would think that for the amount of time it takes for them to spit out food it would be properly cooked no.. Rice is under cooked and stuff just tastes bland.

Normally the employees don't talk much and just carry on with their business, which I don't mind much. However today, my manicurist Michelle stopped my manicure and proceeded to text for 5 minutes (yes, I timed her) right in front of me. She was not waiting for my nails to dry nor was she near done with my manicure. Then, as she was applying the top coat, her hand smudged one of my nails. Obviously this was an honest mistake, and so I just smiled at her. She tried to fix the nail by globbing polish on it, as opposed to redoing it or even just painting smoothly over it. She rushed through the rest of the manicure and was constantly glancing at her phone. Once I was sent to the drying station, I noticed that nail had become clearly crinkled and gross-looking. I didn't see Michelle (my manicurist of the day) anywhere in the area, so I went up to the front desk and politely asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble to fix the nail. They called Michelle from the back room, and she brought me over to the nearest nail station. She proceeded to make pouty noises and complain under her breath about fixing the nail. Once all was said and done and my nails were dry, I went up to the front desk to let them know about the texting issue. \"Hi,\" I smiled, \"I just thought I should let you know that my manicurist was texting during my appointment,\" I told the woman. She murmured out an awkward, \"okay...... sorry\" under her breath. This was what really upset me. In my opinion, a sincere apology was the least she could have done. I don't know if I will be going back to Anthony Vince, but if I do, I will certainly be requesting one of the male staff.", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

I rearranged my schedule to be available, and he was a no show. I reached out to him and he said, oh i can't come today, but i can come tomorrow, i said, well ok - set a time and that was that.  So, friday, 20 min after he was supposed to be here, i texted and was like, so are you going to make it ? He called me shortly after and explained that he could not make it today. i said that this was poor conduct of business as you set the time up and i have to call you to find out you can't come, you should be reaching out to me first, well he stated that he is telling me now. I explained that this was the example of bad customer service and that i could be going with anyone, but i selected him. He said well then its your choice on what to do, i don't feel good.  To be honest, he sounded a little messed up. Then he explained that he was not well. i said well if you are not well you should not be making appts. So i said when can you come, he said sunday, i explained that i have people coming over and that would not be acceptable, but this week i am free and that i was trying to help him out but that he needed to tell me when he was available so i could set my scheudle up.  So monday was agreed on  but not before i was explaining i was doing my best to work with him on this, to which he replied, if you were working with me on this then you would be available on sunday. I explained that he needed to watch it, because he is the business man i am hiring, and that him treating me this way was unacceptable.  He also explained that he did go to doctor for his \"illness\" and that he would not take the medicine due to side effects.  i explained that if he wants to do good business he better get well and quit making appt promises that he can't keep and affecting the customers and their life with us having to keep rearranging our schedules.  Today he was supposed to come (april 11th 2016) at 8 am but i texted him at 830 am. finally he calls me and said i could not come at 8, to which i was super mad already and explained that i was not surprised and he could expect me to write a bad review on yelp and not get any referalls or another good word from me.  to which he said well if you were going to be avaiable tomorrow, i was going to fix it for free. i explained that at this point i don't trust him to work on my microwave and he can keep his lame attempt and forget it at this point.

This is another great example that there are so many places near L.V. to explore the natural beauty this state has to offer and escape the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas.\n\nThe park is 1 mile north of Bonnie Springs, and being a state park requires an entry fee. $9 for non residents and $7 for Nevada residents. The park is full of natural beauty. Located at 3800 feet in elevation it is usually cooler than in town. The road winds up to the parking area, and this leads to a large grassy meadow surrounded by large mature trees, bbq grills and picnic tables along with restrooms on property. Very nice. The property is backed up by the Spring Mt. Ranch and Red Rock which creates stunning vistas behind the park.\n\nThere is the main house/ranch that is still on site. It has a pretty interesting history owned by several people through the years including Howard Hughes at one time. You can tour the house and it is furnished and has many pictures, artifacts etc from its history of owners. Actually very interesting. There is a small gift shop on property with such things as cactus agave jelly and rattlesnake shaped coffee cups. One of which is sitting in my cabinet, from when my wife bought one years ago during our first visit. There are also a few hiking trails in the park that lead back toward the mountains, and one trail that leads to a small lake. Very pretty. \n\nOverall a nice place to spend an afternoon for a hike or picnic or bbq. And get away from the city and enjoy Nevada's natural beauty. One more tip there is also a Summer Theater that runs usually June-Sept. And offers different plays, some of them Broadway hits. They are held in the evenings and you bring a blanket and food and sit out on the grass lawn and watch the show. Nice way to watch a play. Check this State Park out!!", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2}

This place is overpriced, especially for the quality you get. I've had $12 pedicures that would dance circles around these. The woman that took care of my mother was very nice and friendly and she had a good experience, which is why it gets two stars instead of one. The man on the phone said he had openings for two pedicures at 1:45PM.  We got seated in massage chairs in about 5ish minutes, but they are squished together that some of the chairs can't use their built in tables to set a purse or anything on. The only place I had to set my purse and shoes were right in front of the lady in the chair next to mine. My mother was already 15 minutes (or 20) into her pedicure when I finally got someone. He was not friendly but was at least polite. I wanted a two tone ombre style that I had seen posted on this site but he could not do it so he was going to do all little toes one color and then another woman would do the ombre on the big toe. My mother talked me into the luxury pedicure ($30, $20 for basic) and they missed a crucial aspect of even the most basic pedicure. Clean out the fuzz and left ivers that get worked in from socks or wedge in dirt in those corners from wearing flip flops all the time. The guy said he needed to put white on the toe for the ombre so of course I said ok. When he got done, I only waited maybe 5 minutes for the other lady to come do the ombre style. My eyes are not the best and, from where I was sitting, it looked good. Upon closer inspection, it was a very shoddy attempt and a lot fo the white was still showing on the side, along with polish left on the skin. When we went to grab our stuff, I noticed, as walking to the register, my side was cold and damp now. I checked and my large purse was completely soaked through and had leaked on to my shirt and pants. There were no liquids in my purse or that I brought in that could have done. All the other other customers in the store saw this and each made a comment about it. Thankfully, none of the liquid had gotten to my electronics yet. Not a single employee said anything or acknowledged that anything had happened.

I always liked baseball and one of fun ways to spend on the road during the summer is to visit ball park as many as possible.  I usually buy home team t-shirts and hat and cheer for a home team to enjoy a game and atmosphere.\n\nOn this particular day I visited the Chase Field, they didn't fail to deliver great game, fun atmosphere and brought the community together. \n\nThey were giving out D-backs T-shirts to the first 5,000 moms, so we arrived around 10:50am to wait in line.  When we showed up, there were about 150 already waiting.  While we were waiting, one of the players came out to greet us. I thought it was such nice gesture, although I didn't know who he was I appreciated the fact he came out to talk to some of us waiting for a long time for gates to open.\n\nGates opened at 11:30am for 1:10pm game.  They were very organized to give out the T-shirts, they made it easy for us.  They had size L and XL at the gates, and they told us to go near the section 145 to exchange to other size M or XXL. They had plenty of staff on the ground to make the process very smooth.  Thank you D-Backs for the nice T-shirts. I proudly wore them during the game.\n\nI like the way they organized and bring the 20,000 plus crowds together to cheer for the home team.  It takes a lot of baseball loving staff to run a game in the way so organized.\n\nOn Sunday, kids get to run the base, but on Mother's Day, Moms get to run the base too!  Once a year event, and I always enjoy running the base with the kids.  Great way to spend Mother's Day!", "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 4}

It offered free parking, on-site restaurant, and close proximity to the wedding we were attending.  It was nicer than some of the hotels in the area in which the other wedding guests stayed, and in at least one case the price was less at Hotel Universel Montr\u00e9al.  We certainly got better service and a cleaner room than some of them! \n\nWe went to the restaurant the first night.  Nothing fancy, but the price reflected this and we were not disappointed.\n\nOur room was comfortable and clean.  Again, nothing fancy, but it was very comfortable and certainly offered everything we needed.\n\nMost important:  service.  My husband and I get wonderful service often enough that we can compare and contrast, and we expect to receive wonderful service across the board.  Great service began when we checked in: the gentleman who checked us in highlighted the map with the areas we'd had on our itinerary, drew routes for us to help avoid some of the construction on the roadways, and even made tourist suggestions that turned out to be pretty good.  \n\nAn error occurred during our stay. No one was hurt; it affected no one in the world but me, but it hit me hard and I was very angry.  I asked to speak with the manager.  I was as polite as I could be under the circumstances.  Simon, the manager, was not only professional, but he was warm and he was obviously distraught when he heard what had happened. Quite frankly, I can't believe that he managed to make me feel better even though I was so very upset, and I was glad for the opportunity to tell his manager that he is lucky to have Simon on staff.\n\nOf note: When my husband and I came in from the Botanical Gardens that evening, a gentleman at the desk stopped us. He wanted to personally tell me that the error had been his, and that he was sorry.  Since we didn't know him, he could have let us slip by and we would not have known the difference, and that really stood out as five-star service.\n\nEveryone at the front desk was friendly. When we checked out, they moved the line quickly while treating everyone as if s/he was the only guest there.  Nicely done.\n\nWe didn't have enough time to see most of what Montreal had to offer, and the lack of parking downtown due to construction didn't help.  When we go back, we'll be making our reservations at the Hotel Universel Montr\u00e9al.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

I even had a great experience with a piercing less than a month ago.\n\nUnfortunately tonight that changed quite a bit. I went with my partner to get tattooed, and we decided to go later. Since the main location closes at 6, we ended up at their new second location. I was impressed with how clean it was, just like the first.\n\nHaving been told that neither location books appointments on weekends, and its first come first serve, when we arrived at the second one at 5:30pm we were told that the artist already there was booked up until he was to leave at 8:00, but another artist was coming in at 6:30, had no appointments and could take both of us for tattoos. We milled about for an hour and came back.\n\nMy partner decided to go first, so he got his tattoo, and the artist was wonderful. She did a great job, and everything was very clean. As he gets up from his tattoo, the artist begins to set up for the next slot, at around 9:45ish and mentions that a girl who has come in while he was being tattooed has an appointment, so could I wait around? At this point I was a little upset, but I asked how long it would be, and was told her tattoo was much smaller than mine, and should be only about 30-45 minutes.\n\nWe go for dinner, and come back in 45 minutes, at 10:30/10:45 pm. We wait... We wait some more... Never once was I told that it would be a lot longer than the time suggested, which should have been now.\n\nFinally, at 12:00 midnight, I decided it was time to stop waiting. The tattoo that was put ahead of me was no where near done.\n\nI apologized and said I couldn't wait any longer having been there for 6 hrs, and was offered a small discount... Unfortunately, I'll be booking an appointment somewhere else, and won't be going back to use it. It seemed to me no one really cared that I'd waited for 6 hours and gotten nowhere, while someone's friend who had an \"appointment\" that wasn't in the book got done...\n\nThe worst part is, that two of us went there tonight to get tattooed together, and one person had an amazing experience, while the other left extremely disappointed, sad and angry... Recreating the experience is not exactly something we can just go do next weekend, or some other time.\n\nThat's not the experience I expected or wanted to have, but it's what I got.", "useful": 30, "funny": 14, "cool": 6}

(I'm very new to shellfish and I've only had it cold so there was no memory confusion here, folks.)  \n\nSo pretty much that set the tone for the whole meal.  They have a fantastic cocktail menu that he never offered us until I asked...although the cocktails we ordered were far from the best.  \n\nThe entrees were disgusting.  I ordered the Salmon with some sort of soup they poured over it which had a predominate taste of salt.  The salmon was very rare--almost sushi.  Bleech.  I can't remember, unfortunately what my friend had but she gave me an \"ick\" face too.  \n\nI should have stopped eating but the portions were so small I wanted dessert...so I ordered chestnut ice cream.  How can you go wrong with ice cream?  Well, it tasted like chalk.  \n\nIt ended up being about $125 each...wayyyyy too much for that crappy customer service and that lackluster of food.  There are so many great restaurants in this town...don't let what must be the friends and family of the owners convince you with just a handful of reviews to eat at this place.  \n\nIt's been two weeks and I still have a bad taste in my mouth!!!", "useful": 0, "funny": 3, "cool": 0}

And what a surprise! It was dark, cozy (romantic even), lit with tiny candles on the tables, and the back patio was a delight during the summer months. HOWEVER, on my third or so visit, I ordered two Strongbows off the menu. The menu stated that a tall can of Strongbow was $6.75, which is a little pricey, but fairly regular. We finished our drinks and got up to pay our bills. I read my bill and for a second things seemed alright until I abruptly realized that the bill of about $18.00 for two $6.75 Strongbows seemed outrageous, and though I never do say anything, I politely asked why it was so expensive. The waiter (who we'd had before and is extremely charismatic and talkative) faltered, and became awkward all of a sudden, before mumbling that they'd forgotten to change the price on the menu. I paid, and still tipped, but was furious. It's just this kind of thing -- places trying to take advantage of their customers in little ways like this -- really irks me and happens too often. It's also against the law, if you really want to get nick-picky and down to it. I swore I'd never go back to Ciro's again.\n\nAnd I didn't... until about three months later when I was severely hungover and it was cold and my roommate went to get a burger. I tried to go somewhere else, but it was closed! So I went to get a coffee, and I decided to order a side of fries. The side of fries was huge! So generous, and the fries were crispy and thick. It was something like $4.00 which is pretty cheap for a restaurant side of fries where the plate is basically exploding. So Ciro's redeemed itself that day a little bit for me.\n\nIt's a toss-up. I love the look of the place, and it's close to me, and they do have a wide variety of beers and drinks to choose from. In the summer, it's gonna be really hard to resist their quiet, cozy back patio. So maybe I'll keep going there, I'll just have to double-check the prices of all the drinks I'm ordering as I go.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Seven of us came for breakfast for my mom's birthday. They live in Sun City Grand and apparently the only reason Angela's kitchen survives is because there aren't any other choices besides Coco's. Let me start out by saying the server was very nice and did her best to keep our water and tea glasses filled for the 1 1/2 hours we sat on the patio waiting for our food. When it finally came out, my dads eggs were green from being over cooked or sitting under the lamp for too long, mom's omelet looked like it had been sitting under the lamp for an hour. My sister and nephew ordered at the same as everyone else, but his came out 10 minutes after and my sisters waffle came after EVERYONE was finished with their meal. Let alone that we asked for them to open up the patio shades a couple times and they wouldn't because ANGELA wasn't ready to open them yet. After my sister finished her waffle while we all sat and stared at her, they brought the bill and didn't even credit the waffle or my nephew's meal. My dad went in to speak to a manger and apparently ANGELA, said she wouldn't credit any of the meal because the server explained it would be late after everyone else received their meal. I would say ANGELA needs to take a class on customer service and go back to business school (that's if she went in the first place). \n\nONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD FOR BREAKFAST. \n\nSTEER CLEAR OF ANGELA'S KITCHEN AND ANGELA.", "useful": 7, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

It just happened that the other night stars align got together for dinner. Forte for me best of the best comes to Bulgarian or Eastern European food. I came in with open mind not compare both places but obviously similarity in the food and other things very different. Overall say both solid choice if need for legit Bulgarian food.\n\nThe first impression with the ambience and decor interesting. They have the restaurant broken down in two sections on one side there the bar and another side just straight restaurant dining. The whole point of that is restaurant part is non smoking so guess wanted keep it true. You can see the other side since part of it glass walls. I never walked around the bar area but modern, like the way look from the outside, and bar tables area that can order food. In the bar area lots of wide screens usually have games on. They definitely stick with european theme has english premier soccer league games on. Also on the restaurant side they have wide screens. The artwork feels Bulgarian all along the walls. \n\nIt was my first time but like mention earlier cousin is HUGE HUGE fan. So for the most part just followed his lead came to ordering. He recommended trying the stuffed peppers, mixed grill, and the biscuit cake. I started with the chicken soup just cause Forte has the best chicken soup and as much as keep open mind. I saw chicken soup just had to get it. It was good. Talk about huge bowl. It was definitely hearty soup with lots of chicken, potato, and couple more ingredients. Flavor wise good but lacked deep and no WOW like Forte. Forte just fyi half the size bowl. But call it a cliche sometimes bigger not always better. The stuffed peppers was tasty nice feta cheese filling and solid. It deep fried with batter. Again similar but different stuffed peppers at Forte same concept just not batter and deep fried. The mixed grill that was the big comparison. The meats were really good. Three different ones plus pork chop. The names not remember but totally traditional style one sausage link style, another more hand form patty style, lamb skewer, and the pork chop. It was served with massive amount of yogurt /cucumber sauce. The link and patty were both really good. Either spot could just be carnivore all night long. The subtle differences keep going back to between the two spots. The mixed grill at Forte get three different meats only but like the fact the sides get three different awesome sides. Again you get more food for your mixed grill but is bigger always better?? The biscuit cake was interesting. Nothing think traditional biscuit about the dish. Truth it was delicious. It heavy dessert so make sure leave room cause its one of the popular dishes on the menu. One that if going for dessert end night at BG Bistro would highly recommend. The 3 egg omelette exactly that basic but added ham. It was loaded with feta cheese mix. It was actually filling but overall probably not the best item show Bulgarian cuisine. My bet. \n\nThe service was fabulous! One thing interesting they have button that can call the server (they have watches that buzz them). Friendly, attentive, and awesome.\n\nAll the prices are very reasonable most items under ten dollars. The grill items or little more.

By the way, this isn't me complaining. \n\nI have frequented many festivals and LIB is by far my favorite for multiple reasons: great music, amazing art, loads of tasty food, in an out privileges, and multiple bathroom locations. Yup bathroom locations made this list. This can sometimes be often overlooked, but it is an important must have for festivals. \n\nIf you haven't been to Life Is Beautiful is takes place all over downtown Las Vegas. From Fremont Street all the way past the old Western Hotel and Atomic Bar & Liquor Store. This also includes Container Park which closes for the weekend and is only accessible once you're inside the festival grounds. Throughout the streets there are multiple art displays, interactive features, and around every corner there's either a food spot or beer vendor. Although food and drinks tended to be a little on the pricey side, with the awesome in and out privileges, you could go to any one of the many bars or restaurants that surround the venue and not have to pay top dollar for a grilled cheese or Heineken. \n\nParking was never a factor and the grounds themselves never felt crowded, that \"cattle herding\" felling never came over me once. The grounds were mapped out perfectly with multiple pathways leading to the same destinations. Along most of these paths were giant painted wall murals or pieces of 3-D Art that stopped you in your tracks and made for sweet photo ops. As corny as this sounds, I think these pieces of art and the constant reminder that, \"You Are Beautiful\" kept everyone in high sprits with smiles and random high fives. The, \"bro-factor\" was kept at bay and I never once witnessed a fight or festival goers acting like over-privileged jerk offs.\n\nThe music was on point and every band seemed to be feeding off the \"beautiful\" vibe that the crowd was putting out. Every band I stayed to watch gave nothing but praise to the Vegas crowds. Some of my personal favorites of the weekend were Alt-J and The Arctic Monkeys. I hate to say this but, Outkast was pretty boring (I'm probably going to get some hate on that comment). Artist I'm bummed I missed were Phantogram, Broken Bells, and Girl Talk.\n\nI heard the Chef stages in Container Park were amazing, but sadly I never had a chance to check them out; there was just simply too many things to do. That might be my one beef... Too many fun things to do or at least try to do over the course of three days. \n\nThis review could on forever and from the looks of it, it kind of does. You really just have to experience this event for yourself. Food, Music, and Beauty.\n\nWhat else do you really need?", "useful": 13, "funny": 11, "cool": 13}

Read less \n\nSo, first off?  I was at the establishment listed in the \"Owners\" response.  And I have no idea where his 25+ floor staff were or his hosts for that matter.  Never saw a single one of them helping of addressing anyone at the entry.  No one ever made eye contact, no one ever even recognized we were there.  Secondly, there is a sign when you enter that states \"Pease wait to be seated\".  Thirdly, the \"owner\" states he or she has no \"hostess station but they have 5 hosts! Where do these hosts work out of? What do they do? The \"owner\" needs to accept and own an honest review of his business like it or not. But saying that, what I and my party experienced in his establishment, didn't happen because he says so? Is just a sad and weak retort.  The \"owner\" can post whatever he or she wants.  The truth will be in the service they deliver.  Personally I am insulted by the \"owners\" response, for all intensive purposes, he or she is calling me a liar.

So moving on to nipple clamps they had this amazing glass case with some amazing nipple clamps in it! And this time I believe Dana and Hanna helped me. Just making sure on which one will be the right one and all. I actually picked a really hardcore one! Which works just wonder guys if you like pain and pleasure :) \n\nAnd then TJ checked me out and made sure that I got everything I needed! And asked how was my Experience and all. \n\nOverall; well done place! And again I am super happy that you guys finally decided to open love store in downtown so I don't have to feel unsafe going to those places anymore!! I shall return!

The cost was always lower than anywhere else and I never felt like I was told I needed unnecessary repairs, until recently. I walked in right at opening time and noticed right away that everyone was new. I didn't see anyone that I was used to seeing. Already I didn't feel comfortable. Then I met the owner and another lady that said she was from corporate office. The lady did not look like anyone I've ever seen from a corporate office. Jeans & t-shirt. This is going to sound unusual, but the owner, Teddy, was overly friendly. Teddy greeted everyone who came in with a hug and said \"Hi I'm Teddy and this is my shop!\". Just too much. Some people might call it great customer service, but I don't. Comes off as fake and uncomfortable. The caffeine he had just while I was there... 2 Red Bulls & Starbucks. Anyway, I was there 1st thing in the morning and it took an hour & a half to get my oil change done. I had never waited more than a half hour before these new people. When Teddy came to get me after the oil change and inspection, he told me I needed brakes and my roters were getting damaged by them because they were Auto Zone brakes and installed incorrectly. I told him I've never had my brakes replaced and they should still be factory. He insisted they were from Auto Zone and need to be replaced asap. I went for a second opinion and turns out I do not need brakes and they are in fact still factory. Not from Auto Zone. Nothing wrong with my roters. He also had suggested my k service. They must have made this recommendation just by looking at the mileage or trying to make more money because I had my k service last year. I won't need it for a while. By the end of all this, I was late for an appointment. I told Teddy I didn't have time to change brakes right now... and I didn't. Before I left, he wanted to show his concern for my safety and offered to do the repairs and I could pay later if I didn't have the money. I told him that wasn't the problem. I was late and really had to go. An offer like that doesn't sound like a good business deal at all. I didn't feel genuine concern for my safety. Instead I saw desperation.

I have been dying to eat at Social House ever since it opened & I was hoping I liked it better than I did. For now, it's pretty much a solid 3 star. I've gone a few times at night for drinks, but had dinner reservations on a Friday night for 8 of us. It was a great place to go with a large group. I will start by saying that the atmosphere is literally amazing inside of Social House. The interior and vibe inside basically account for the 3 stars I have given it. Like a lot of other reviewers have said, it reminds me of a swanky NYC restaurant. It really is stunning!\n\nThe service was just OK- nothing extravagant about it but nothing wrong with it. Everything seemed to take a little longer than it should have, which was fine since we were there to catch up with each other anyways. Because it did take a little while to be served, we ended up ordering our drinks and food at the same time. My friend and I started with the Ki King Broccoli as an app. This broccoli was so good and very unique from anything I've ever had! It was tempura fried and had some kind of sesame sauce. For dinner, everyone at the table ordered sushi rolls. They had a lot of options but the Volcano roll caught my eyes pretty quickly! Others at the table got the California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Godzilla Roll. Our waiter brought the sushi rolls out at all different times, which I thought was kind of weird.  As far as the sushi goes... nothing special. Everyone at the table agreed that we have had much better sushi (and for cheaper!) \n\nAs far as Social House goes, I would say that you are for sure paying for the atmosphere and experience of this restaurant. It's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, just wish the food wowed me a little bit more!", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

On one hand, they provide a quick, casual option for lunch, but on the other hand, the space occupy is very tiny and I think they are playing the volume game here in serving the Uptown lunch crowd.\n\nSince this location is well within the Overstreet Mall, it's really only accessible via foot.  If I had to drive and find parking to wait in a large line, this would never be on my lunch \"go-to\" list.  Once you get there and depending on the time, the line can snake... I mean snake out the door.  It's not as bad as the Chick-fil-a line... but I think this line does not tend to move quite as fast as the well-oiled machine that have farm animals encouraging you to eat more chicken.\n\nIf you dine in... and I usually do, because I don't want to bring my food back to my depressing cubicle and stare at the screen that I will be staring at for the majority of my work-day.  There maybe me 6, four top tables and one large round table for a tight squeeze of 6 people.  They also have \"bar seating\" shoved up against the wall.  My last experience, I got stuck in the corner and it was awkward getting in and out.  Luckily the nice ladies sitting next to me were nice enough (or they saw the puppy dog look on my face) and helped me in and out.\n\nTypical Mcalisters menu here, but this is where I start to think they are geared for \"grab and go\" since I usually get chili in a bread bowl \"FOR HERE\"..... the first time I got it, it arrived and was in a \"build your own lunch\" format.  Bread bowl wrapped in saran wrap, chili in a separate sealed container.  OKAY it took like 30 seconds to take the plastic off and pour the chili into the bowl, but I felt like I was making my own lunch.  Small thing, but it is just not very \"come in and have lunch with us\"... it's more like, \"grab your ish and go back from whence you came.\"\n\nOther than that... it definitely fills a need in the Overstreet Mall.

My nail tech accidentally touched my skin with the drill and it started to bleed- accidents happen and I truly wasn't bothered by that- she then pulled out a product that I assume is to stop the bleeding. She literally squeezed the product out of the bottle rubbing the nozzle directly on my open bleeding wound. You need to take this more seriously as I could have HIV or a blood borne pathogen or someone before me could and you just contaminated someone!

I ran out to my car to get cash instead of using my credit car, and Darl, the proud owner, caught up with me to ask me if I found everything I needed, and wanted to know if there were any foods or goods I would want them to carry. Love that! He was great to talk to, and seems genuinely interested in creating an awesome local market. They have lots of local foods, from Crave ice cream to artisan bread made in Tempe, to local cheeses and produce from nearby farms. And they're friendly to boot. Support them! Tell them what you want! Buy your fruits, veggies, and breads there, and you'll definitely go home a happy customer. \n\nOh, and by the way, the soup came out delicious thanks to that turnip.

My new AZ friends host an annual Mardi Gras party with a live band and I received my invite at the end of December, reminding me to start thinking about a costume.  I had no idea what to wear and decided to find a costume shop online for ideas.\n\nEasley's presented itself as the only real option that was close (even though it took 40 mins to get there from Surprise) and boasted a host of costumes that could be rented or purchased.  This was great for 2 reasons--I didn't want to buy a costume that I'd only wear for 1 night if it were going to cost more than $30 and didn't have the time/patience to throw something together as I heard many of the past partygoers suggest.  (I do have a normal day job & sewing is not one of my domestic skills!)\n\nUpon arrival, the storefront looked smaller than I imagined.  I assumed it would be like a Costco warehouse b/c there were so few costume stores in the Phoenix area, and if this were 'it' for costume stores, I just thought it would be aisles and aisles of costumes where I might have to push around one of those oversized carts and then buy a polish hotdog afterward b/c I'd be so famished from shopping.  But that was not the case.\n\nIn this compact little space, they organized the store very well and utilized every possible inch of wall space to display what they didn't have room for on the floor.  Since Mardi Gras was a few weeks away when I was shopping, they had racks of rental costumes and an entire section with accessories.  I found what I needed quickly--a floor length cape for $25 and a huge gold crown.  It was perfect.  (Please note, that although the Mardi Gras costumes were my main concern & the focus of this post, they had a ton of other things in there).\n\nWhile I was waiting in line, I couldn't help but notice how many different varieties of bunny head masks they had for rent.  There must have been about 15 different bunny heads mounted on display.  Who knew bunny costume renters would be so particular about the facial features on a bunny head....?", "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 1}

Create and use handmade props to build a simple set. And work with an overhead camera to tell a story frame-by-frame.\n\nManchester Craftsmen's Guild, were the teens got to watch current students demonstrate on the potter's wheel, as well as use an interactive Photo booth. Attendees will be able to print their own photos to take home. Current students demonstrating on the potter's wheel, as well as an interactive Photo booth. They were also able to print their own photos to take home.\n\nThe Mattress Factory, were the teens got to combine a small motor, battery, cool trash and a marker to create a beautiful and unexpected drawing.\n\nPittsburgh Filmmakers, were the teens got to explore creating their own surface pattern design repeats with hands-on collage techniques using 2D and 3D collage materials. For those who wanted to take it further got to use a scanner, Adobe Photoshop and color copies to visualize what they're pattern would look like as wallpaper, or fabric.\n\nPittsburgh Center for the Arts, were the teens got to create a unique jewelry pendant, earrings or key chain using the enameling process - the art of fusing glass to metal. The resulting objects combine the best properties of both elements: the strength and durability of metal with the shine and color of glass. \n\nPittsburgh Glass Center, were the teens got to make their own glass paperweight, flower or pendant.\n\nUnion Project, were the teens got to watch live demonstrations and got a chance to go for a spin on the wheel.\n\nThe Warhol Museum, were the teens got to join artist educators from The Andy Warhol Museum in silk-screen printing and button making. Remix and collage imagery to make cool layered prints and buttons.\n\nThe teens also got to dance by music provided by Kelly Strayhorn Theater, Swag Monkeys and Tracksploitation and got to watch Andrew the Impaled, Pittsburgh's premier pain proof clown and performance arsonist.\n\nThey even got to eat furnace-fired pizza, gooey s'mores and more! My daughter absolutely loved the event and can't wait for it again this year. \n\nI love the Pittsburgh Glass Center but, must say that some of the prices for events are too high for most people to be able to afford going to the center very often. Maybe if they offered a Groupon or something like that. But, all in all, the Pittsburgh Glass center is a must see.", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 6}

It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.\n\nI was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.\n\nWith a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.\n\nI ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.\n\nFor my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.\n\nFinally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.\n\nService was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.\n\nThis is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas.", "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 8}

I had one of the worst experiences, let me share a bit of my night .\n\nThere were some art shows and presentations down Roosevelt Street, I believe it is called \"First Friday\". Walked past a cute little building and saw it was Pomo and remembered that was on my list for places to try out. We get there and it is relatively busy as I would expect on a Friday night, the hostess was nice and very kindly cleaned a table for us to sit in. It took about 10 minutes plus for someone to bring us water. Then she finally came back and seemed extremely stressed (not to mention this was the first time I have ever seen a waitress wear a mini jean skirt and an apron) I was very shocked they allowed her to wear that as everyone else was wearing black jeans or work pants. We had been sitting there for over 20 minutes and were very ready for some food. I ordered a glass of wine and a pizza Margherita. The pizza came out within 5 min yet my glass still never arrived. A tall man who seemed to be the manager walked by us looked at the table, didn't greet us nor notice we had no extra plates or silverware on the table. I had to wave down the hostess and she kindly brought us the silverware and some oils and pepper flakes.  I was nearly done with my meal when the waitress finally returned to checked back up on us. I told her my wine never arriving and she just gave me a strange look, I believe she just never put it in. After reminding her about my glass she still didn't offer to get me the drink. I was very annoyed but trying to keep my calm, it was noticeable english wasn't her first language but I don't think I was too difficult to understand my order.\n\nAfter that she started coming to check on us a bit more often since she noticed I wasn't in a very good mood. A big table beside us had just left and I noticed she did not help pick up a single cup both times she went out there. The hostess cleared the whole table, seemed like that young girl and the kitchen were the only ones working.\n\nThis isn't even the worst part yet. I went into the ladies room and there is a horrible oder, seem like someone couldn't hold it and pooped on the ground. The worst part is that it looked like someone tried to just clean it with paper towels instead of giving it a proper clean. I could not finish my business, I quickly left and told my husband to pay in cash so we could just get out of this place as quickly as possible. I hate not leaving a proper tip but I do not believe she even earned any of what we did leave her. \n\nI was extremely disappointed with my experience, the food was very good, saddly I can't actually leave a rating based on just that.", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1}

When the T-Bird opened on South Eastern years later, it was a nice addition to the neighborhood. \n\nPro's: They still have the same menu; Food quality is still decent; Wait staff is generally pleasant; Juke box and billiard options are a nice touch; Prices are reasonable. \n\nCons: Often times (late at night), the bartender is the server and (although generally friendly), it feels like diners are \"in the way\" of bar ops. The bartenders during the Day and Swing hours do not seem overly friendly - to say the least. The atmosphere is not as \"cozy\" as the Tropicana location used to be (and perhaps still is). \n\nStill, I do make the trip to this place every now and then for a late night snack or sometimes an early morning coffee & omelets before a flight out of town. \n\nOverall review: 3 stars.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Not A Good Egg.  Nay!  It's The Good Egg!\n\nLet me give my fans the backstory of this review.  Ahem...\n\nI use to Live with a 63 year old man I refer to as Smoky Joe.  Now this guy is old...like older than 15 presidents...that's old.  \n\nHe'd teach me bout the whereabouts of aliens, how they visit us on Earth and why we need to find peace within the world in order for these intelligent lifeforms to finally reveal themselves.  \n\nHe was also the best d#%m cook that I'd ever had the luxury of trying.  From fish with cheese perfectly flexed in the center to ribs that were so tangy and juicy that the meat would literally slip off the bone.  He knew his stuff.\n\nNow we'd always go to this spot on Saturdays to catch up on my craziness as he'd cut out coupons for Albertsons and Fry's coldcuts (Albertsons coldcuts are a joke).  \n\nDuring this weekly event I'd always order the, Say Cheese, and play around with the options available to be put into my omelets (bacon, sausage, chicken, broccoli, etc).  He'd go for a single blueberry pancake and would smoke his cigs in between the wait time.\n\nWed enjoy some coffee and the fine service of the woman (no babes here, just strong independent woman.  Lets go!)\n\nOverall the service was consistent.  The staff would get us some solid deals with their stamp deals per entrees and they'd treat us to hot hot coffee.  \n\nOther times they'd make a few mistakes, but all is forgiven if they'd hire more babes.  \n\nHere's to use good egg...you r The Good Egg\n\n#Saycheese #Realwomen #Stampsonstamps", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0}

They have the husband's favorite yogurt place, Yogurberry, so that's a plus.  I also think the Famous Dave's should be open now, yum!  I like the design of this area, it's quite expansive but still walkable.  I agree with Melinda S., and I think she was spot on when she said this place is kind of like Disneyland in its setup.

We got out order all messed up, the waitress said the grill person was new and we didn't mind at all, we understood and said it was fine. Food was neither good or bad, very average. The problem was the waitress' attitude towards her coworkers, she started yelling at them saying that the order was all messed up and blah blah blah, then she started yelling to the manager that she needed help and that she was about to leave; it was so uncomfortable to be there, the manager went to our table to ask what else we were missing and I could see that she was about to cry. The waitress wasn't rude at us but it was really awful to see the way she acted in front of the customers. Two or more people actually left the place before even ordering.
